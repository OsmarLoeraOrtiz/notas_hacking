# Bandit Level

## Objetivo
The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to **a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000**. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it
